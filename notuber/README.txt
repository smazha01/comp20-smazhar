        1. Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented 
           and what have not.

                To my knowledge, all aspects of the work has been implemented 
                correctly. 

                A map using the Google Maps API is loaded, my location is 
                retrieved using the JavaScript object navigator.geolocation, 
                my location is correctly sent to the ride request API, either
                vehicles or passengers are shown on the map, depending on what 
                I am, and all info windows display the username and how far 
                they are from me. No JQuerey was used during this assignment 
                and no errors or debugging output code is shown. This is why I
                believe my work has been implemented correctly and 
                successfully.


        2. Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the 
           assignment.

                I did not collaborate with anyone for this assignment besides
                looking/posting Piazza posts. A large portion of the code 
                to integrate the Google Maps API was taken from Ming Chow's 
                example in the COMP20 github repo. Also, the code to find the 
                distance between two points was taken from a post on
                StackOverflow. The link is in the spec.


        3. Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the 
           assignment.

                I spent roughly 10 hours on this assignment
