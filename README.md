1. What is the purpose of this Git repository?

      The purpose of this Git repository is to serve as a portfolio, to showcase and document the work I've completed in COMP 20 - Web Programming Spring 2018. 

2. What was your favourite lab or assignment and why?

      My favourite homework assignment has to be the client side of Notuber. Learning about HTTP requests were crucial to this class, and I felt that this assignment solidfied my understanding. I also really enjoyed tinkering around with the Google Maps API and adding to the map.

3. How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?

      I truly believe that I've grown tremendously in this class, not solely as a web developer, but also just as a programmer. This class covered some fundamentals, such as what happens when we visit a website on the browser, or what a port is. Beyond that, I learned much more about building websites, as well as the servers that support them. It's difficult to quantify all the possibilities that this class provides, but I certainly do intend on exploring them, and continuing with web development.

4. What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.

      The most important skill I learned in COMP20 was how to solve complex issues independently and how to debug more efficiently. I learned sometimes googling on how to fix something is the most useful tool to my disposal. Just as well, cleverly placed console.log() statements or going through the logic makes debugging exponentially faster. I think that with web development, there are chances for errors in so many places, that I have learned how to debug more efficiently.

5. Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?

      There are two major realms that I think I'd like to delve further into. Firstly, I really liked the final assignment, and would like to learn more about security. Secondly, I genuinely enjoy building websites from scratch, without templates. I would love to have more experience with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery.
