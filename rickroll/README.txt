        1. Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented 
           and what have not.

                To my knowledge, all aspects of the work has been implemented 
                correctly. Every line of the lyrics to the song "Rick Roll" is 
                shown at the correct time using javascript and some styling
                was completed.


        2. Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the 
           assignment.

                I did not collaborate with anyone for this assignment besides
                looking at Piazza posts. I gained inspiration from the double
                rainbow example in the COMP20 github repo.


        3. Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the 
           assignment.

                I spent roughly 5 hours on this assignment
